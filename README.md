# FlightGearBuild

## Description
This is a repo to build the nightly build of FlightGear on Windows, as the Jenkins server seems dead and gone.
It uses the guidance at https://wiki.flightgear.org/Building_using_CMake_-_Windows to do the simplest possible build.

## Installer
A simple installer is generated using Innosetup.
